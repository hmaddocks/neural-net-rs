# neural-net-rs

This code was originally based on [neural-net-rs](https://github.com/your-username/neural-net-rs). It has been changed and extended so much that it no longer bears any resemblance to the original code. I would like to thank the original author for their work and for inspiring me to extend this project.

## MNIST

This code (currently) implements a neural network to train and test on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
